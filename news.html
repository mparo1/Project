<h2>Ben Platt's New Album</h2>
<h6>Date: March 29th, 2021</h6>
<img src="prop.images/benplatt.jpg" alt="Ben Platt" title="Ben Platt in Dear Evan Hansen">
<p>
  Tony Winner and <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> original cast member, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Platt">Ben Platt</a> 
  announced today, on the two year anniversary of his debut album <i>Sing To Me Instead</i>, that 
  he will be releasing his next album in two weeks. His debut album made the US Billboards
  Top 20 and UK Billboard Top 100 after its release. <i>Sing to Me Instead</i> is a deeply personal album
  where Platt unofficially comes out to his fans as gay. He told People Magazine last year, "If I was
  going to write about people I loved, I wasn't going to pretend they weren't men just because I hadn't talked
  about that before." If you haven't already listen to
  <i>Sing to Me Instead</i> I highly recommend it. You can find it

<h2>Video Submission Auditions</h2>
<h6>Date: March 29th, 2021</h6>
<img src="prop.images/christinedaae.jpg" alt="Christine Daae, Phantom of the Opera" title="Christine Daae, Phantom of the Opera">
<p>
  Broadway has not been able to hold open calls for roles as they are currently on pause, so they are 
  turned to the "new normal" in today's society: video auditions. Many other tv shows and movies have already captitalized
  on this opportunity to cast with video submissions. Earlier this week, <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> issued a casting call
  for the lead female role, Christine Daae, earlier this week. This will allow the casting crew to have
  a wider accessibility pool with the same requirements as always, but easier accessibility. This will cut costs on money and time of
  travel for those auditionees. <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> is hoping that they will find their Christine and be able to put her
  on stage by the planned opening date in June.
