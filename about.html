<h2>Why Broadway?</h2>
<h4>
  I fell in love with Broadway musicals in high school after performing in our annual
  Cabaret concert Freshman year. Every January, my mom and I have
  gone to New York to see a show. This past January my mom and I had tickets to see <i>The Book of Mormon</i>
  but our plans were changed due to COVID-19 and the pause on Broadway. Although <i>The Book of Mormon</i> has
  not yet been released on film, my mom and I filled the void this January by watching some of our other favorite musicals
  on streaming platforms. <br>
  Above I have attached an image of me performing "Burn" from the musical Hamilton during my Senior year Cabaret concert.
  This may be the moment I completely fell in love with musicals and performing as it was my last moment on stage
  at my high school.
