<h1>My Top 10 Musicals</h1>
  <h2>1. Hamilton</h2>
  <img src="prop.images/hamilton_019_w1_28048dcc.jpeg" alt="Hamilton" title="Hamilton">
  <p> Hamilton is a sung-and-rapped production about founding father, Alexander Hamilton, and 
    his story back in the late 1700s, early 1800s. This story is told about early Americans by Americans now. I saw <em>Hamilton</em> 
    live back in January 2020 before Covid-19 struck the U.S. I did not see it live
      but it was just as remarkable as it is to watch it online. I did not know exactly
    what the music meant before watching it live or even online. The movement and production
    shows another light to the musical that you can get while watching it live. I will never
  take away from the musical on Broadway (because it is a once in a life time experience), but 
  it is the closest you can get to the real thing. It is one of my favorite shows to watch
  online and if you have not I suggest giving it a view.You can find <em> <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/hamilton/3uPmBHWlO6HJ">Hamilton</a></em> 
  on Disney Plus. <br> <em>My favorite song from this musical is "One Last Time."</em>
